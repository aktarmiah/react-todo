# React TODO Test

## Problem Description:
You're given a React application that implements a basic to-do list. However, it's poorly structured, has unnecessary complexity, and exhibits some minor functional issues.

This test is designed to understand your ability to understand a task, execute changes, and prepare a pull request for review.
As such, please resolve the tasks concisely.


## Tasks
1. Fork this repository
2. Understand the existing code
3. Identify and fix any bugs or functional issues
4. Add new features
5. Create a pull request, following best practices

### 1. Fork this repository:
First fork this repository into your personal Github account (a public fork).

### 2. Understand the existing code:
Analyze the code and understand its current functionality.

### 3. Identify and fix any bugs or functional issues:
- Ensure the to-do list works correctly. Fix any bugs before moving on to code improvements.
- Refactor the code: Please move the list item renderer into it's own component definition
- Make the todo list sit in the center of the page (horizontally and vertically).
- Clearly mark all commits as `bugfix:`, `cleanup:`, etc.

### 4. Add new features:
Please add these features in the simplest, most concise way possible.

- Add an '[x]' anchor element to the end of each item in the list to remove it from the list
- Add a new button to remove all completed items from the list
- Add another filter. Add a new filter to only show list items which contain two or more words. This should work in combination with the existing Active/Completed filter.

### 5. Create a pull request, following best practices:
- Create a pull request in your own fork of the repository
- Add a description to the pull request outlining the changes made
- Add comments to any code changes which the reviewer might need some context to understand
